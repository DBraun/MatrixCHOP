/*

This example file implements a class that does 2 different things depending on
if a CHOP is connected to the CPlusPlus CHOPs input or not.
The example is timesliced, which is the more complex way of working.

If an input is connected the node will output the same number of channels as the
input and divide the first 'N' samples in the input channel by 2. 'N' being the current
timeslice size. This is noteworthy because if the input isn't changing then the output
will look wierd since depending on the timeslice size some number of the first samples
of the input will get used.

If no input is connected then the node will output a smooth sine wave at 120hz.
